<p>This node offers health checks for the flow(s) in a containerized environment.</p>
When added to a flow, this node will start an HTTP server, listening on a defined port (default: 80) and providing three paths: <code>/started</code>, <code>/ready</code> and <code>/alive</code>.<br>
<br><div class="infoBoxS">Please note that only one health checks node can be defined within ALL flows and subflows!</div><br>
<h3>Integration</h3>
This node offers three paths: <code>/started</code>, <code>/ready</code> and <code>/alive</code> at a configured port.<br>
These paths can be used as HTTP probes in a containerized environment.<br>
Each of the paths will check for one or more of the defined <strong>conditions</strong> and return a <code>200 OK</code> or <code>500 Internal Error</code> if at least one of the conditions failed. Additionally, the body will list the condition(s) that failed.

<h3>Example</h3>
Let's think about a flow, subscribing to an MQTT message broker (using an <strong>mqtt in node</strong>).<br>
A <strong>health checks node</strong> will then define a condition, named for example  'MQTT connected' and add this condition to all 3 probes.<br>
A watchdog will check for the <strong>mqtt in node's</strong> status (one of 'connected', 'connecting' and 'disconnected') and its color ("green" if connected) in particular. On a status change, the health checks node's condition will be set accordingly using a <strong>switch node</strong>.<br>
The container framework will frequently call the container's HTTP probes and decide what to do, if a check fails.
